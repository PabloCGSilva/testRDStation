# Customer Success Balancing

This project implements a system for balancing customers and Customer Success (CS) managers based on their respective scores. The system assigns customers to CS managers with scores closest to the customer's score, taking into account the availability of the CS managers.

Usage

To use the Customer Success Balancing function, you can import it into your own JavaScript code and call it with the required parameters. Here's an example:

javascript

const customerSuccessBalancing = require('./customerSuccessBalancing');

const csScores = [
  { id: 1, score: 50 },
  { id: 2, score: 100 },
  // Add more CS scores as needed
];

const customerScores = [
  { id: 1, score: 20 },
  { id: 2, score: 30 },
  // Add more customer scores as needed
];

const unavailableCSIds = [2]; // CSs on leave

console.log(customerSuccessBalancing(csScores, customerScores, unavailableCSIds));
